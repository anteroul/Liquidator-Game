# Story so far:
Few weeks ago a chemical weapon research facility exploded. A special operation rescue squad was sent but contact was lost shortly after. Immediately a special task force was sent to investigate the area and found humananoid like creatures with super human strength and strongly violent behaviour. In a matter of days all residents living in the nearby villages were infected with the same behaviour. Researchers suspect an exposure to Mutagene AFDP-16, a chemical agent that turns humans into bloodthirsty monsters.

The military has hired you to protect the border. A fearless mercenary well experienced with firearms. You are paid well and will be greatly rewarded if the mission is successful. Otherwise you will be executed. Failure is not an option!
